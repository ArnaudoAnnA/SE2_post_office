TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 3)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done

  3/3

- Total points committed vs. done

  12/12

- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)

  49h / 50h 50m

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |     3   |    -   |     17     |   16h 15m    |
| _#1_   |     3   |    5   |     6      |   5h 35m     |
| _#2_   |     4   |    5   |     15     |     21       |
| _#3_   |     3   |    2   |     11     |     8        |

- _#0_ corresponds to the initial setup of the database (including the design phase) and the NodeJs server
- _#1_ : Customer select service
- _#2_ : Counter presses next
- _#3_ : Customer goes to counter

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Estimated Hours per task average: 3h 46m
- Actual Hours per task average: 3h 54m
- Estimated Hours Standard deviation: 3h 28m
- Actual Hours Standard deviation: 3h 49m

- Total task estimation error ratio: 49h / 49h 50m = 0,983m 

[sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1]

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 3h 30m 
  - Total hours spent: 5h 20m
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 0 (4 manual)
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 3h
  - Total hours spent: 4h
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 1h
  - Total hours spent: 1h
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

We found some troubles during the estimation phase first of all because it was the first time that we start thinking about it. Secondly it was challenging for us to split stories in tasks because there were a lot of common jobs that don't precisely fit in a specific one. Finally, every one of us has different approaches to achieve the same goal and we didn't know our respective way of working. 

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

The positive thing is that every one of us has learnt some new technical things. However, we found out that communication is extremely important for the success of the team, especially before starting the developement phase we missed a global agreement on how code and tests should be written

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 

This is our first retrospective activity
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

This is our first retrospective activity

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

1) We will need, for the following sprints, a precise definition of roles inside the team itself, dividing jobs in a more specific way in order to avoid overlapping and conflicts
2) We need a more precise definition of the test process

  > Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

We are a very solid team: all people are committed in the same way, with the same conviction and motivation. We also quickly built a friendly and inspiring team environment. 
(and we even offer each other the coffee :))
